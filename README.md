# nuxt-payload-template

> ⚠️ Work In Progress
>
> This template is slightly opinionated based on my main use case for client work, but the core monorepo structure is still a good basis for any Nuxt/Payload project.
>
> I update the repo and packages manually as I continue to refine things during the course of my projects.
>
> If you have any questions/suggestions, feel free to open up an issue.
>
> Old versions that uses Payload CMS v2 & v3 available on `v2` and `v3` branches.

## Setup

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are defined in `.env` and shared between apps with `dotenv-cli`. Variables prefixed with `PAYLOAD_PUBLIC_` are exposed to Payload's client-side app.

Running `pnpm configure-env` will guide you through creating a `.env` file.

| Variable                        | Default          | Description                                                 |

| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYLOAD_API_ROUTE` | `/payload-api`   | Route used for Payload's API                                |

### Custom Local Hostname

You will need to set up a custom local hostname for local development, using NGINX and the provided `conf-examples/nginx/local.conf` config. If you use [`mkcert`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) for local SSL certificates, you can use the provided `conf-examples/nginx/local-mkcert.conf`.

Make sure the update the `server_name` directive, any changes to the default ports, and the `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key` paths if required.

You will also need our hosts file so the custom hostname resolves to `127.0.0.1`:

```
# /etc/hosts

127.0.0.1       example.test
```

> 💡 [`hostctl`](https://github.com/guumaster/hostctl) is a nice CLI tool for managing your hosts file

## DX

### Payload Types

Payload types can be generated by running the `generate` command

```bash
pnpm run generate --filter payloadcms
```

You can easily access Payload's generated types within the Nuxt workspace using the `#payload-types` alias

```ts
import type { Image } from "#payload-types";
```

> 💡 Type imports must be explicit since Nuxt 3.8, so make sure to use `import type ...`

### Type-safe Relationship Fields

Payload Relationship fields for GraphQL queries are typed as `string | MyCollectionType` (or `string[] | MyCollectionType[]` when the field uses the `hasMany` option). This is because querying the field without any subfields will return the document ID:

```graphql
# Will return an ID
query GetRelationship {
  doc {
    relationshipField
  }
}

# Will return an object
query GetRelationship {
  doc {
    relationshipField {
      subField
    }
  }
}
```

This can cause type issues when using these fields within Nuxt, so there is a composable that can be used to assert the type of relationship fields.

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
const doc = useRelationshipField(data.doc.relationshipField); // RelationshipType | null
const docs = useRelationshipField(data.doc.relationshipHasManyField); // RelationshipType[]
</script>
```

### GraphQL Exports

GraphQL documents are generated from the `.gql` files in `apps/nuxt/graphql`, and output to `apps/nuxt/graphql/index.js`. You can regenerate the exports using the `generate` script

```bash
pnpm run generate --filter nuxt
```

> 💡 Nuxt's generate script will also query the Payload schema, so make sure the Payload app is running (via dev server or otherwise)

### `usePayloadPage` composable

The `Pages` collection is set up for building predefined page templates, and the `usePayloadPage` composable makes it easy to retrieve page data using Apollo, while also automatically set any SEO/Meta values provided by `@payloadcms/plugin-seo`.

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
const doc = await usePayloadPage("Home");
const fields = doc.value?.homeFields;
</script>
```

### Globals

Globals data is located in the `~/stores/globals` store, and is preloaded during SSR (see `apps/nuxt/app.vue`).
